# Corona Virus Analysis
## Analyzing the global effects of Corona Virus from January 2020 to June 2021.

# About the Internship:

* Organization: Mentorness
* Type: Remote
* Duration: 26/05/2024 to 26/06/2024
* Number of tasks: 3

# About the Project:

This project is done as a part of Mentorness Internship from 01/06/2024 to 12/06/2024. This is the task 2 where I am analyzing the data about the number of confirmed, dead and recovered cases of Corona Virus pandemic in various countries recorded between January 2020 to June 2021.

# Problem Statement:

The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, you have been tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present your findings.

# Deliverables: 

* Project Source Code: SQL file with queries
* Dashboard
* Presentation Report
* Video Presentation explaining the approach towards dataset, problem statement, inferences drawn, final outcome and future scope

# Tools Used:

* Microsoft Excel: For Data Cleaning and Transforming
* Microsoft SQL Server: For Data Analysis
* Power BI: For Data Visualization and Dashboard
* Canva: For creating Project Report
* GitHub: Documenting the result

# Methodologies Used:

* Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Reporting

# Data Decription:

The Dataset contains 78387 rows and 8 columns that provides information about the number of confirmed, dead and recovered cases of Corona Virus pandemic in various countries recorded between January 2020 to June 2021.

| Column Name | Datatype | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Province | Str | Geographic subdivision within a country/region |
| Country/Region | Str | Geographic entity where data is recorded |
| Latitude | Str | North-south position on Earth's surfacen |
| Longitude | Str | East-west position on Earth's surface |
| Date | Str | Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data |
| Confirmed | Str | Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases |
| Deaths | Str | Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths |
| Recovered | Str | Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases |

# Data Exploration:

I am tasked to find answers to these 16 questions using SQL queries. So here I'll provide the answers.

-- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values.

-- Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 

-- Q3. check total number of rows.

-- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date.

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset.

-- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered.

-- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month. 

-- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year.

-- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year.

-- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month.

-- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case (e.g., total confirmed cases, their average, variance & Standard Deviation).

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month (e.g., total confirmed cases, their average, variance & Standard Deviation).

-- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case (e.g., total confirmed cases, their average, variance & Standard Deviation).

-- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case.

-- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case.

-- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case.
